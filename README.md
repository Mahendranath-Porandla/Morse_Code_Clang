This project is a simple implementation of English to Morse code and Morse code to English conversion using C programming language. The program takes user input in the form of English words or Morse code and converts it into the other form based on the user's choice.
The program starts by defining a static array of strings that holds the Morse code representations for English alphabets and numbers. It then defines two functions, englishToMorse() and morseToEnglish(), that convert English letters/numbers and Morse code respectively.
The englishToMorse() function takes an English letter/number as input and returns its Morse code representation based on a lookup in the morse_table. The function also handles special characters such as space, dot, comma, etc., and returns their corresponding Morse code.
The morseToEnglish() function takes a Morse code string as input and returns its corresponding English letter/number based on a search in the morse_table.
The main function reads user input and calls the appropriate function based on the user's choice. If the user chooses to convert English to Morse code, the program iterates over each character in the input and calls englishToMorse() to get its Morse code representation. The program then prints the Morse code output to the console.
If the user chooses to convert Morse code to English, the program splits the input into individual Morse code words and calls morseToEnglish() to get the corresponding English letter/number. The program then prints the English output to the console.
Overall, the project is a good example of using lookup tables and string manipulation in C programming. It can be further improved by adding additional features such as audio output of Morse code or graphical user interface for ease of use.
